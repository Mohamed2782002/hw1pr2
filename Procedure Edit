// Task 1: Blow me away - says the paper airplane!
step 1  : first you need a paper
step 2  : draw a perpendicular line down the middle of the paper
step 3  : fold the paper along line that you created 
step 4  : open the paper until you see the line that you drew and created by folding the paper
step 5  : grab the paper from the top right corner
step 6  : fold the corner towards the middle to create a triangle with one line on the crease
step 6  : align the upright triangle with the perpendicular line 
step 7  : grab the triangle from the bottom right corner
step 7  : fold the paper again, but this time fold the corner under and towards the center instead of over 
step 8  : align the triangle that you created with the perpendicular line. 
step 9  : repeat the same process on the left side
step 10 : fold the paper using the perpendicular line 
step 11 : make sure you see one big triangle on each side of the paper after folding it
step 12 : unfold the big triangle on each side to create the wings
