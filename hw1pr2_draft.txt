// Task 1: Blow me away - says the paper airplane!
step 1  : first you need a paper
step 2  : draw a prepindicular line down the middle of the paper
step 3  : fold the paper using the line that you created 
step 4  : open the paper untill you see the line that you drawed and created by folding the paper.
step 5  :  grab the paper from upright corner.
step 6  : fold the paper to create a triangle with one line on the crease?
step 6  : align the upright triangle with the prepinduclar line. 
step 7  : grab the triangle from the bottom right. What's the bottom?
step 7  : fold the paper again.
step 8  : align the triangle that you created by folding it with the prepindicular line. 
step 9  : repeat the same process on the left side using the side with the conrner on the opposite side.
step 10 : fold the paper using the prepindicular line 
step 11 : make sure you see one big triangle on each side of the paper after folding it.
step 12 : unfold the big triangle on each side. I'd say, something a bit more specific like pull it out from the most recently folded triangle on each side.
